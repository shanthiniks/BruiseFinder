#  BruiseFinder: Early Detection and Classification of Bruise in Plum Fruit using Hyperspectral Images🍒🔍 

Hyperspectral images of both unbruised plums and plums with impact-induced bruises are captured at seven different time intervals 
(30 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours). These images are used for early bruise detection and classification of bruise in plum fruit.
The technology also aims to differentiate between natural fruit decay and bruising. <br><br>
This code is based on the paper:
SS-CNN BruiseFinder: Hyperspectral Imaging and CNN-Driven
Spatial-Spectral Fusion for Non-Destructive Plum Bruise Analysis
Shanthini K.S., Sudhish N. George, Jobin Francis and Sony George.

#  Key Features 🔑 

A convolutional neural network (CNN) model that leverages 3D convolutional layers to integrate spatial and spectral features from hyperspectral data, enabling accurate bruise analysis in plum fruit. 

This innovative technology integrates hyperspectral imaging with deep learning, with unprecedented analytical capabilities.

Capable of monitoring bruise development over time (30 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours).

The model is also equipped with early bruise detection.
